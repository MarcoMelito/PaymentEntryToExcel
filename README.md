# PaymentEntryToExcel
Through a UI, data can be entered on payments made via POS, and the data is saved to a daily Excel file and an Excel file containing all payments made.

The daily files are saved in a daily folder, and the folders are moved to a monthly folder when creating a file for a new day.
From the script it is possible to look at the daily payments entered, perform a search, and obtain all payments entered.

I used the following toolkits/libraries:
- Tkinter
- customtkinter
- CTkTable
- Pandas
- os
- openpyxl
- shutil


I know it is not perfect and could be improved, but I created this script for work in 2023 and at that time it was not necessary to make it perfect.
